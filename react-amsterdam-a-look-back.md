React Amsterdam took place last week in Amsterdam Noord organized by [GitNation](https://gitnation.org/) an amazing group of folks who do an amazing job at running developer conferences like [JS Nation](https://jsnation.com) another Netherlands based JS community project and now conference, [React Day Berlin](https://reactday.berlin) a first of ti's kind ful day conference in Berlin Germany, and others. The conference was attended by more then 1500 React developers. I attended the conference, volunteered for both days of workshops and ran a booth for my company [Progress](https://www.progress.com/) geared around bringing awareness to our suite of React components called [KendoReact](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/).

The conference started off strong with Kent C Dodds on the main stage with a talk called ["Requisite React"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KfAS3zrvX8&t=1405s). The way I interpreted this is that he would talk about the things important and necessarry in React to know as a developer in the React space and in his words, "Taking a few steps back and thinking about the usefulness of the fundamentals".

I am highly biased having spent some good quality time with Kent and helping as a volunteer during the workshops and getting to see him in action and get a taste for his teaching style. But I thought this was one of the most important and valuable talks of the conference. This is the type of information I have been looking for from a React confernce talk.

He also makes it clear in the talk that he is not an advocate for gatekeeping and doing things just because someone else is mandating or suggesting they are best practices. This is important to hear and although most of us know this, I'm sure we can all think of times when we have been caught up in this as developers. Why are we using a specific linting rule, why are we testing redux's output here. Are we testing implementation details, asking a lot of why's and getting rid of practices or not following ones that can waste our time or not provide value.
