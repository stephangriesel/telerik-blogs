React Amsterdam took place last week in Amsterdam Noord organized by [GitNation](https://gitnation.org/) an amazing group of folks who do an amazing job at running developer conferences like [JS Nation](https://jsnation.com/) another Netherlands based JS community project and now conference, [React Day Berlin](https://reactday.berlin/) a first of ti's kind ful day conference in Berlin Germany, and others. The conference was attended by more then 1500 React developers. I attended the conference, volunteered for both days of workshops and ran a booth for my company [Progress](https://www.progress.com/) geared around bringing awareness to our suite of React components called [KendoReact](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/).

## Conference Day Highlights

There were so many great presentation and Lightening talks, I want to take some time to highlight what I think were the most valuable ones that I attended. Bieng someone who works with a lot of UI, layout and presentation in React, I am a big proponent of the fundamentals and general knowledge. i start to get lost when it comes to the advanced and deep dive topics outside of UI and basic React, and what's great about this conference is that they have something for everybody. Let's look at some of those talks and review them here:

### Requisite React (Kent C Dodds)
The conference started off strong with [Kent C Dodds](kentcdodds.com/about/) on the main stage with a talk called ["Requisite React"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KfAS3zrvX8&t=1405s/). In his own words, this talk is about: "Taking a few steps back and thinking about the usefulness of the fundamentals". We learn how to fix a droopy facuet head (with pics), and learn how understanding abstractions help us to be more effective when using them, not only in real life ðŸ˜Š but also in our code. This means being mindful of our abstractions and understanding that each one ultimately has some type of cost. My favortie abstraction that he dives into is that of JSX and I won't ruin the talk, but getting a look at how we can easily convert our Babel into raw JS, we are able to see under the hood and understand this abstraction better. I felt a lot of the talk was mostly about how to level up as a React developer and if you were a boss or manager who sent several of your developers out to [React Amsterdam](https://react.amsterdam/), this is exactly the type of information you want out of the gate!

### Refactoring React (Siddarth Kshetrapal)
No time is wasted getting into another very valuable fundamentals based talk, again we are defintiely getting our value right out of the gate with many helpful tips this time from [Siddarth Kshetrapel](https://github.com/siddharthkp/) an independent devloper from India who does an amazing job refactoring a login and authentication form. Starting with class components and constrtuctors with a fair amount of prop drilling involved, we refactor this code quickly into something more manageable and future proof. Some of the techniques that he talks about are spreading props, using methods passed down in props the proper way and how to ensure that we are not overriding prop values for methods or aplying them due to not managing our props correctly. He touches on principles like "Single Responsibility" and "Seperation of Concerns".

## React is Amsterdam

Talk abouit how Amsterdam is a perfect city for JavaScript and more importantly React developers.  SOme of the sponsors at the vents were based in or had offices in Amsterdam or Netherlands. The city offers so much in historical, artistic, tech and shopping, so it's obviously a great place to bring the React community and is very relaxed yet highly invigorated at the same time. Given enough time and the ability to travel throughout the city and learn the Metro, Dutch national rail company NS (Nederlandse Spoorwegen) and the various other ferry and tram systems, you can easily move around to the areas that you want to visit and crank up the energy or turn it down by traveling just out of the city's center.

I stayed in the Wilbautstraat area just 4 stops off the metro from Central Station at a wonderful hotel that I talk about more in my [Developers Guide to React Amsterdam](https://dev.to/httpjunkie/the-developers-guide-to-react-amsterdam-4h60/).

## React 2020
