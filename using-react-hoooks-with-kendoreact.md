With the release of Hooks, building React applications and managing local state of components is now easier, more straight forward and concise. Yes there is a lot to know about Hooks from a conceptual standpoint, and we have many articles here on the Telerik blog to help you get aquainted with Hooks and started using them in your application. Building React applications has not always been a breeze, in fact before Hooks there was a lot you had to know about several patterns and practices in React just to do everyday things like state management, seperating logic within your components, ensuring that you could share lifecycle methods and such across components and resusing rendering logic across many components. The reoccurring theme here is code reuse. 

To really get the best out of your React application, understanding how to achieve this has not always been straight forward. It required understanding about several different techniques like, Mixins, Higher Order Components and Render Props just to do very basic co-location of logic and state for the pruposes of reuse. before Hooks, React developers when faced with ever growing local state concerns would sometimes reach for Redux or MobX to manage their state. I did it. Using these state management tools for local component state has never felt like a perfect fit to me, but it was often done and in some case done instead of using local `this.state` provided by React and accessible using class based compoenents. Using Redux probably wasn't the right choice, but if you did use it you were hit with the overhead of understanding it and writing a majority of the boilerplate. We should also understans that without Redux we may not have sthis amazing way of working with state in React Hooks, so the fact that we were out there experimenting with Redux the right or the wrong way and all of those pains invloved, that work is not lost. I believe that going through those pains made us the React that we are today with this new way of dealing with the issue.

We have turned a corner in the React world however, today these problems have a very simple and straight forward solution, but it does take some getting used to and practicing with React Hooks. If you are new to React or React Hooks I got you covered, let me suggest a few articles before we get going, just in case you feel you need a refresher on any of the topics below. Feel free to wander off and I will wait right here for you, then we can dig into using React Hooks with [KendoReact](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/):

These articles are in a way companion articles for the ReactJS.org documentation and blogs written around the subject. To learn Hooks properly I think you need to do several things. First is to checkout the ReactJS.org documentation. Everyone who uses Hooks with great success right now has probably read through all 8 pages in the ReactJS.org docs. Next, they move onto other articles that help them apply what they know and give similar examples to the docs but with working code to go along with it. I do this in my articles using [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/). You can find all of my demos just ready to be forked on my [StackBlitz profile](https://stackblitz.com/@httpJunkie).

I still think there is one more step and that is a combination of writing hooks for your own applications as well as understanding how to refactor older class based syntax to use Hooks. I should say this second part with a statement along side it that "Not everything needs to be rewritten". My point is that in order to understand how Hooks are going to help you, you need to understand what it took to write the same code without Hooks, how to refactor that code properly into Hooks and also how to add new functionality or features using custom hooks of your own. It's not my opinion that in order to have a good grasp on React one will at least need to understand Hooks as one of the most important concepts outside of creating components in Ract going forward. You may not need to learn the old class based stuff (maybe until you need to for some reason). But I still know of code in my projects written in classes that I'm not completely sure I know how to rewrite in Hooks, it's OK for this code to just exist as it is. It's going to run right along side any code that is taking advaage oh Hooks. The release that makes Hooks available is backwards compatiable and as I said will live aalong side any new code you write with zero issues.

Now that we understand where to get information o Hooks
