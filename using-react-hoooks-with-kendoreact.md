With the release of Hooks, building React applications and managing local state of components is now easier, more straight forward and concise. Yes there is a lot to know about Hooks from a conceptual standpoint, and we have many articles here on the Telerik blog to help you get aquainted with Hooks and started using them in your application. Building React applications has not always been a breeze, in fact before Hooks there was a lot you had to know about several patterns and practices in React just to do everyday things like state management, seperating logic within your components, ensuring that you could share lifecycle methods and such across components and resusing rendering logic across many components. The reoccurring theme here is code and logic reuse and to do it well, it required understanding about several different techniques like Mixins, Higher Order Components, and Render Props. Before Hooks, React developers when faced with ever growing local state concerns would sometimes reach for Redux or MobX to manage their data  and communication state, this was a natural use for Redux, but there are other forms of application state that using Redux is typically a poor choice for. Before Hooks was released, this type of state was accessed using class based components that would interact with `this.state`, a convention that React is familliar with and allowed us to instantiate and update in a one way data flow pattern.

**We may talk about concepts in this article that you may or may not understand, below are some articles that explore the different ways to use Hooks. If you feel that you don't understand something in this article it's most likely easy to look up and dive deeper in these article I have provided**

- [Say Hello to Create React App (2/3)](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/hello-create-react-app-2) to help get started in React
- [Learn Basic React Hooks State and Effects](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/how-to-use-basic-react-hooks-for-state-and-effects) for local state and effects

These articles are in a way companion articles for the ReactJS.org documentation and blogs written around the subject. To learn Hooks properly I think you need to do several things. First is to checkout the ReactJS.org documentation. Everyone who uses Hooks with great success right now has probably read through all 8 pages in the ReactJS.org docs. Next, they move onto other articles that help them apply what they know and give similar examples to the docs but with working code to go along with it. I do this in my articles using [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/). You can find all of my demos just ready to be forked on my [StackBlitz profile](https://stackblitz.com/@httpJunkie).

I still think there is one more step and that is a combination of writing hooks for your own applications as well as understanding how to refactor older class based syntax to use Hooks. I should say this second part with a statement along side it that "Not everything needs to be rewritten". My point is that in order to understand how Hooks are going to help you, you need to understand what it took to write the same code without Hooks, how to refactor that code properly into Hooks and also how to add new functionality or features using custom hooks of your own. It's not my opinion that in order to have a good grasp on React one will at least need to understand Hooks as one of the most important concepts outside of creating components in Ract going forward. You may not need to learn the old class based stuff (maybe until you need to for some reason). But I still know of code in my projects written in classes that I'm not completely sure I know how to rewrite in Hooks, it's OK for this code to just exist as it is. It's going to run right along side any code that is taking advaage oh Hooks. The release that makes Hooks available is backwards compatiable and as I said will live aalong side any new code you write with zero issues.

Now that we understand where to get information for Hooks, let's talk about a few ways you can easily get started with Hooks
