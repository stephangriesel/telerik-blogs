We get you up and running with our native UI component library for React JS.

[KendoReact](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui) is the latest offering from Progress in the JavaScript framework space. It is one of two offerings that we have built from the ground up using native components that that are composable and configurable to your needs. These are components that range from everyday use to robust interactive components like [Grids](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/grid/) and [Data Visualizations](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/charts/). For forms we have [inputs](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/inputs/), [dropdown lists](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/dropdowns/), [buttons](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/buttons/), and more!
