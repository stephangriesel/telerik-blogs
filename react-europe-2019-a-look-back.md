TLDR; I talk about my experience at the conference as a first year attendee and link to all of the talks at the bottom! [Take Me to The Talks](#Talks-on-YouTube)

For the 5th year in a row, React Europe has held an amazing conference in Paris France. My company ([Progress Software](https://www.progress.com/)) had an amazing time not only as a sponsor of the event presence at the conference [sponsoring](https://www.react-europe.org/#progress) the main [conference](#conference) event and a [hackathon](#hackathon).

The event was held at the [Espace Charenton](http://www.espacecharenton.com/index.php?lang=en) event center in the Porte de Charenton area of Paris and drew about one thousand React developers from all over the world. Host and emcee [Jared Palmer](https://twitter.com/jardpalmer) leaded the conference with a really good message about blah blah blah.


We heard from many amazing speakers at this event, some of them were veterans to react Europe like [Lee Byron](https://twitter.com/leeb) who is the only speaker to have graced the React Europe stage every year since it began in 2015, [Michael Westrate](https://twitter.com/mweststrate), [Ives van Hoorne](https://twitter.com/compuives), [Brent Vatne](https://twitter.com/notbrent), [Josh Comeau](https://twitter.com/joshwcomeau).

But as an avid viewer of the previous years talks I noticed a lot of new faces that I thought had extremely amazing talks. I caught quite a few of them in person like: [Ankita Kulkarni](https://twitter.com/kulkarniankita9), [Charly POLY](https://twitter.com/whereischarly), [Olga Petrova](https://twitter.com/tyoushe) [Ella van Durpe](https://twitter.com/ellatrx), and [Alec Larson](https://twitter.com/alecdotbiz), [Charles Mangwa](https://twitter.com/Charles_Mangwa), [Lisa Gagarina](https://twitter.com/lisa_gagarina) and [Tim Neutkens](https://twitter.com/timneutkens) just to name a few.

It's important as a conference to not simply progress with more advanced talks each year and not have something for those who are new to React or even the industry for that matter. This keeps the roster of speakers each year fresh and keeps form alianating newcomers to the React space making sure there is something for everyone.

A few talks were what I feel to be a little on the advanced side and this is OK. One in particular was [Julien Verlaguet](https://twitter.com/jverlaguet)'s talk on [SKIP](http://www.skiplang.com), the language recently open-sourced by Facebook a research project which was to explore language and runtime support for correct, efficient memoization-based caching and cache invalidation. Or I think he described it better when he said that it's a programming language built from the ground up with the ideas of React ar it's core as React shifts the way we think about state. 

I can't talk about everything that was presented on at the main stage, we would be here for hours, but it's all a great reason to go and check out day one and day two of the conference on YouTube, I'll put a list of all of the talks below so you can pick and choose and jump staight to the individual talks.

## Hackathon

This was held on the Saturday after the conference. We posed a KendoReact challenge, offering attendees the opportunity to win an Apple Watch by hacking a demo we put together where attendees built a travel booking site using our React components.

![Hackathon Prizes Image](https://d585tldpucybw.cloudfront.net/sfimages/default-source/default-album/prizes.png?sfvrsn=4a645c98_1)

This event was attended by about 20 developers that stuck around an extra day to try their hand at our coding challenges.

![Hackathon Attendees Image](https://d585tldpucybw.cloudfront.net/sfimages/default-source/default-album/hackerz.png?sfvrsn=a2cb2465_1)

Everyone did such an amazing job that we decided to give three runners up KendoReact licenses as well!

One winner (shown above), who combined both our KendoReact challenge and the AWS Amplify challenge, took home the well-deserved Apple Watch and a KendoReact license. As I said above three runners up also walked out with a KendoReact license. Thanks to everyone who participated!
